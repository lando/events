  summary: |
    Developers who need to quickly move between projects, or just want a simpler 
    way to set up and develop for Magento, can utilize Lando and Cypress in 
    their work. The Lando tools are great for repeatable container and 
    environment setup, and Cypress can make end-to-end functional testing as 
    easy as writing a macro or business test. This presentation is from Meet 
    Magento NYC 2024.

    ground, safely replicating the real-world environment you and your team face
    in production. What if I told you that Lando is also your production
    facility, your launchpad, and your mission control?

    having an organizational DevOps plan/strategy and some cross project
